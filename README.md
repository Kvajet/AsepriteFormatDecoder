# Aseprite file format decoder

## Why?

Aseprite is my favourite app for my pixel art creations. It allows some scripting in Lua but it is not enough. Aseprite contains feature to rescale exported image by 1000% but it simply is not enough in some cases. So I would like to create simple script decode aseprite file format.

## May I use it?

Sure, every Aseprite friend is also friend of mine. It would be nice to include me as author. But who am I to force you, right? :-)

## My sources

All used documentation so far: 
- [Aseprite official file format description](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/docs/ase-file-specs.md)

## [haHaa] Why is it written in C++? I want Prolog version.

Go for it and just do it. I simply like C++. :P
